# Microsoft-New-Movie-Studio-Insights

## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.


## Business Understanding


Microsoft wants to create a new movie studio. However, lacking expertise in the film production, the goal is to understand the current successful movie trends and identify successful movie genres driving Box Office performance. The findings will aid in shaping the studio's decisions regarding the genres of movie to produce and ensure alignment with the market demands and audience preferences.

This analysis will answer the following questions:
* Which genres have the highest audience engagement?
* Does duration/runtime of movies have an impact on the viewers rating?
* Can the language in which movies are originally produced affect their popularity and success?
* How do successful films perform in international markets compared to domestic markets?



## Data Understanding


To better understand Box Office performance and movie industry in general, and address Microsoft business problem, we need to collect and analyze data. Information that was collected and used for analysis are movie genre, movie titles, movie ratings, movie budgets, popularity, foreign and domestic gross income, runtime and release dates. 
Here's a breakdown of understanding the importance of using these information during the analysis:
1. Analyzing genres helps in understanding audience preferences, trends, and market demand. It allows for comparisons between different genres and their performance in terms of ratings, revenue, and budget.
2. Analyzing ratings helps in assessing audience preferences and predicting potential success at the box office.
3. Understanding the budgeting aspect is crucial for assessing profitability and financial performance. Analyzing budgets in relation to revenue and ratings provides insights into cost efficiency, profitability, and investment strategies within the film industry.
4.  Box office revenue, both domestic and foreign, is a significant metric for a movie's success. Analyzing these figures allows for understanding regional preferences, global market penetration, and the overall financial success of a movie.
5. Runtime influences audience engagement and theater scheduling. Analyzing runtime in relation to ratings and revenue can provide insights into audience preferences for movie length.
6. Analyzing popularity metrics helps in understanding the buzz around a movie, its reception pre and post-release, and potential audience turnout.


During this analysis, there are several datasets that will be used from various sources. 

Here are the Sources:
* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/)

The graph shows that movies made in English, labelled as "en", are most popular compared to movies in other languages. English movies have a bigger chance to be seen by many international audience, which helps them to be popular and successful.



## Conclusion


From the analysis, here are the observations made:

* Adventure, Animation and Comedy genre have a strong preference since it is most prefered by wide range of audience. Based on this analysis this is the top performing genre at Box Office. Movie enthusiasts often find this genre very enjoyable and captivating, making them favored picks among audiences. On the contrary, the least watched genre is History, its performance indicates that its only appealing to few audience.

* Higher average ratings tend to go to movies with longer runtimes, which shows that audiences prefered movies with longer runtimes. Movies with longer runtime provides more content and storytelling. On the contrary movies with shorter runtimes has limited time for storytelling, character development and less content, and this ends up with lower ratings. No one wants a movie with less content and limited storytelling.

* Movies that use English Language tend to reach international audience because most people around the world speak and understand English. In the analysis it shows that English can be easily accessed by most audience include the international audience.



## Recommendation


I would like to recommend the following to Microsoft:

1. Prioritize the Adventure, Animation, and Comedy genres:

Microsoft stands to benefit by focusing on creating films in these genres, as they happen to be the highest performing genres. They have widespread appeal and target a broad audience globally, potentially resulting in higher revenue for Microsoft.

2. Prioritize longer runtimes in movie production:

Longer movies tend to allow for character development, deeper storytelling, and engaging narratives, which lead audiences to give higher ratings. This strategy enhances audience engagement and improves perceptions of film quality, favoring richer content in movies.

3. Prioritize the creation of films in the English language:

Since the English language is widely understood by most audiences, creating films in English allows for resonance with international audiences. This approach can increase potential earnings and elevate global recognition for the film production.
