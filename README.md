# Microsoft-New-Movie-Studio-Insights

### Business Problem

### Overview


Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.


## 1. Business Understanding


Microsoft wants to create a new movie studio. However, lacking expertise in the film production, the goal is to understand the current successful movie trends and identify successful movie genres driving Box Office performance. The findings will aid in shaping the studio's decisions regarding the genres of movie to produce and ensure alignment with the market demands and audience preferences.

This analysis will answer the following questions:
* Which genres have the highest audience engagement?
* Does duration/runtime of movies have an impact on the viewers rating?
* Can the language in which movies are originally produced affect their popularity and success?
* How do successful films perform in international markets compared to domestic markets?



## 2. Data Understanding


To better understand Box Office performance and movie industry in general, and address Microsoft business problem, we need to collect and analyze data. During this analysis, there are several datasets that will be used. The datasets contains movies information such as genres, runtime minutes, movie budget, gross income, popularity, movie rating, movie titles and release date.

Here are the datasets files that will be needed for analysis:
* `bom.movie_gross.csv`
* `im.db`
* `rt.movie_info.tsv`
* `rt.reviews.tsv`
* `tmbd.movies.csv`
* `tn.movie_budgets.csv`



## 3. Data Preparation



## 5. Conclusion

From the analysis, here are the observations made:

* Adventure, Animation and Comedy genre have a strong preference since it is most prefered by wide range of audience. Based on this analysis this is the top performing genre at Box Office. Movie enthusiasts often find this genre very enjoyable and captivating, making them favored picks among audiences. On the contrary, the least watched genre is History, its performance indicates that its only appealing to few audience.

* Higher average ratings tend to go to movies with longer runtimes, which shows that audiences prefered movies with longer runtimes. Movies with longer runtime provides more content and storytelling. On the contrary movies with shorter runtimes has limited time for storytelling, character development and less content, and this ends up with lower ratings. No one wants a movie with less content and limited storytelling.

* Movies that use English Language tend to reach international audience because most people around the world speak and understand English. In the analysis it shows that English can be easily accessed by most audience include the international audience.

## 6. Recommendation


I would like to recommend the following to Microsoft:

1. Prioritize the Adventure, Animation, and Comedy genres:

Microsoft stands to benefit by focusing on creating films in these genres, as they happen to be the highest performing genres. They have widespread appeal and target a broad audience globally, potentially resulting in higher revenue for Microsoft.

2. Prioritize longer runtimes in movie production:

Longer movies tend to allow for character development, deeper storytelling, and engaging narratives, which lead audiences to give higher ratings. This strategy enhances audience engagement and improves perceptions of film quality, favoring richer content in movies.

3. Prioritize the creation of films in the English language:

Since the English language is widely understood by most audiences, creating films in English allows for resonance with international audiences. This approach can increase potential earnings and elevate global recognition for the film production.
